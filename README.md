# simjo
simjo is a simple journaling app with Node, Express and Handlebars. Users can write journal entries that will be displayed with the date that they were created. The entries are written to JSON file. To use, you will need to Node installed on your computer. After cloning these files, type npm init and then npm install into your environment terminal. 

In the future I plan to add an acutal database, plus implement modify and delete functions.
